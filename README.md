Create a set of API endpoints already defined below and use data structures to store data in memory (don’t use a database).

On Pivotal Tracker, create user stories to setup and test API endpoints that do the following using data structures
Get all diary entries.
Get a specific diary entry.
Add an entry
Modify an entry.

On Pivotal Tracker create stories to capture any other tasks not captured above. The tasks can be feature, bug or chore for this challenge.

Setup the server side of the application using the specified framework.

Setup linting library and ensure that your work follows the specified style guide requirements.

Setup test framework.

Version your API using url versioning starting, with the letter “v”. A simple ordinal number would be appropriate and avoid dot notation such as 2.5. An example of this will be : https://somewebapp.com/api/v1/users.
Using separate branches for each feature, create version 1 (v1) of your RESTful API to power front-end pages

Write tests for the API endpoints

Ensure to test all endpoints and see that they work using Postman.

Integrate TravisCI for Continuous Integration in your repository (with ReadMe badge).

Integrate test coverage reporting (e.g. Coveralls) with badge in the ReadMe.

Obtain CI badges (e.g. from Code Climate and Coveralls) and add to ReadMe.

Ensure the app gets hosted on Heroku.
